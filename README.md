# Civilization Restart MVP

## 1. Config

​		The entire project is based on ELM.

​		Run the makefile to compile the Game.

## 2. How to play

For the MVP project, we only supply the basic mode.  Here are the keys that you will be used in the game

​	1)	WASD for moving Up,Left,Down and Right.

​	2) 	M for moving into the next floor.

​	3）  G  to open the test window for Dialogs.  Enter for the next sentence. 

​	3)	Moving the mouse to aim.

​	4)	Left-Click  to Shoot	

## 3. Known Bugs

​	1) The collision with the walls. We now just stop the player if he is going to collide with the wall.

​	2) We haven't write the screen adaptation for the Mini Map, so it may overlap with the Main Map.

​	3) For test reason, the Players' speed is faster than the bullet's speed, so if you are shooting while moving, it will look weird.
